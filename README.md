To start the app, run

``` cmd
python flaskr\init.py

## Notes

- double check the parameters in "conn = pymysql.connect(..."
  - for me, it is port number 3306, but it may differ for your machine when running MySQL from XAMPP
  - I named the database in PHPMyAdmin as "Project" but you might have named it something else
